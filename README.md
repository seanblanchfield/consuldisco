# ConsulDisco

This is a simple python package to help applications to discover service endpoints for services registered in Consul. This is useful, for example, when a python application wants to discover the address/port information of a local database, queue, SMTP server, or redis/memcached instance by service name, thus avoiding the need to hardcode local service addresses into code or configuration files.
